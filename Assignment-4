Here are the solutions to your questions:

### 1. Capacity of the Tank

**Given:**
- Leak can empty the tank in 6 hours, so the leak rate is \( \frac{1}{6} \) tank per hour.
- Inlet pipe fills at 4 liters per minute, which is \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \) liters per hour.
- When both the leak and the inlet are open, the tank empties in 8 hours.

**Let \( C \) be the capacity of the tank in liters.**

**Total outflow when both are working:**
- In 8 hours, the tank empties: \( \frac{C}{8} \).
- Net outflow rate: 
\[
\frac{C}{8} = \text{Leak rate} - \text{Inlet rate} = \frac{C}{6} - 240.
\]

Setting up the equation:
\[
\frac{C}{8} + 240 = \frac{C}{6}.
\]

Multiplying through by 24 to eliminate fractions:
\[
3C + 5760 = 4C \implies C = 5760.
\]

**Answer**: **The capacity of the tank is 5760 liters.**

### 2. Percentage of Literate Females

**Given:**
- Total inhabitants = 1000.
- Males = 60% of 1000 = 600.
- Total literate = 20% of 1000 = 200.
- Literate males = 25% of males = 25% of 600 = 150.

**Literate females:**
- Total literate = 200, and literate males = 150.
- Therefore, literate females = \( 200 - 150 = 50 \).

**Total females:**
- Total females = \( 1000 - 600 = 400 \).

**Percentage of literate females:**
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{50}{400}\right) \times 100 = 12.5\%.
\]

**Answer**: **12.5% of females are literate.**

### 3. Percentage of Candidates Failed in Both Subjects

**Given:**
- Passed in English = 80%.
- Passed in Mathematics = 85%.
- Passed in both = 73%.

Using the inclusion-exclusion principle:
\[
\text{Passed in either subject} = \text{Passed in English} + \text{Passed in Mathematics} - \text{Passed in both} = 80 + 85 - 73 = 92\%.
\]

**Therefore, failed in both subjects:**
\[
100\% - 92\% = 8\%.
\]

**Answer**: **8% of candidates failed in both subjects.**

### 4. Percent Increase in Savings

**Given:**
- Monthly income = 13,500.
- Monthly expenditure = 9,000.
- Income increase = 14%.
- Expenditure increase = 7%.

**New Income:**
\[
\text{New Income} = 13500 \times (1 + 0.14) = 13500 \times 1.14 = 15390.
\]

**New Expenditure:**
\[
\text{New Expenditure} = 9000 \times (1 + 0.07) = 9000 \times 1.07 = 9630.
\]

**New Savings:**
\[
\text{New Savings} = 15390 - 9630 = 5760.
\]

**Old Savings:**
\[
\text{Old Savings} = 13500 - 9000 = 4500.
\]

**Increase in Savings:**
\[
\text{Increase} = 5760 - 4500 = 1260.
\]

**Percentage increase:**
\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left(\frac{1260}{4500}\right) \times 100 \approx 28\%.
\]

**Answer**: **The percent increase in savings is approximately 28%.**

### 5. Days to Empty the Tank with 70 Pumps

**Given:**
- 49 pumps can empty the tank in 10 days, working 10 hours a day.
- Total hours needed by 49 pumps = \( 49 \times 10 \times 10 = 4900 \) pump-hours to empty the tank.

**Rate of one pump:**
\[
\text{One pump's rate} = \frac{1}{4900} \text{ tanks per hour}.
\]

**Total pump-hours for 70 pumps working 7 hours a day:**
\[
\text{Rate for 70 pumps} = 70 \text{ pumps} \times \text{rate} = 70 \times \frac{1}{4900} = \frac{70}{4900} = \frac{1}{70} \text{ tanks per hour}.
\]

**Days required:**
\[
\text{Time to empty the tank} = 70 \text{ hours (1 tank)}.
\]

With 70 pumps working 7 hours a day:
\[
\text{Days} = \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ days}.
\]

**Answer**: **The tank can be emptied in 10 days.**
